    <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> My husband's grandmother was from Bavaria, and his mother learned how to cook their Christmas-Day sauerbraten meal from her. I learned from my MIL, so that tradition has continued. That being said, I know how tasty, homemade, long-marinated sauerbraten really is supposed to taste. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p><ul>
                <li>2 pounds cubed beef stew meat</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
                <li>1 cup red wine vinegar</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>3 cups egg noodles</li>
                <li>3/4 cup crushed gingersnap cookies</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul></p>     
                
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Combine beef stew meat, onion, beef broth, vinegar, and bay leaves in a slow cooker.        </li>
        <li>Cook on Low for 7 to 9 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Remove bay leaves from beef mixture; stir in crushed gingersnaps and brown sugar. Cook beef mixture on Low until thickened, about 15 minutes. Serve sauerbraten over egg noodles and garnish with parsley.</li>
